Title: Identification of the Most Influential Nodes (Hubs)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Adrian (Abbas) Salavaty
Maintainer: Adrian (Abbas) Salavaty <abbas.salavaty@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains functions for reconstruction of networks from
    adjacency matrices and data frames, analysis of the topology of the network 
    and calculation of centrality measures, and identification of the most
    influential nodes (network hubs). Also, some functions have been provided
    for the assessment of dependence and correlation of two network centrality
    measures as well as the conditional probability of deviation from their
    corresponding means in opposite direction.
